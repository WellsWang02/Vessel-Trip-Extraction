The processing of sattelite data for vessel trajectory preprocessing and trip extraction.

In this notebook a series of methods were developed to process vessel trajectories. ***Noise Filtering*** filter the raw trajectories into cleaned and denoised trajectories. ***Stay point detection*** is conducted to cluster the stay points. Finally, ***Port labeling*** is conducted to classify if a stay point is ported, awaited for porting (near the lands), or stay at sea. Finally, ***Segmenation*** segments the vesssel sub-trajectories as vessel trip segements.
